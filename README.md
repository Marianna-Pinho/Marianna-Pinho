#### ðŸ”­ What am I working on?

I'm currently a Master's student in Computer Science at Unicamp. <br>
My research is about using data augmentation to help in image <br>
classification problems with deep learning. If you are interested, <br>
my proposal for the Masters Qualification Exam can be found [here](https://www.ic.unicamp.br/~zanoni/students/mestrado/marianna/proposta.pdf).

#### ðŸŒ± What am I learning?

Throughout my journey in the computing world, I'm being able to learn <br> 
a little about many interesting things, such as:
  - *Embedded systems and Linux programming*: [BabyMonitor](https://github.com/Marianna-Pinho/Sistemas-Embarcados-Final-Project),
  [Sistema single board para monitoramento aÃ©reo](https://github.com/Marianna-Pinho/TCC02-Implementation/tree/master/01-Final_Monography_Codes/01-Collector_ADSB_C). 
  - *Web development*: [Web classes](https://github.com/Marianna-Pinho/Software-Development-WEB-Classes).
  - *Computer networks*: [CN projects](https://github.com/Marianna-Pinho/Redes_de_Computadores), [Distributed systems](https://github.com/Marianna-Pinho/Sistemas_Distribuidos).
  - *Machine learning*: [ML classes](https://github.com/Marianna-Pinho/Machine-Learning-Classes), [Evaluation metrics for classification problems](https://www.kaggle.com/mariannapinho/evaluation-metrics-for-classification-problems).
  - *Digital image processing*: [DIP classes](https://github.com/Marianna-Pinho/Introduction-Digital-Image-Processing).

My new adventure has been to dive deeper into the data world, learning more<br> 
about machine learning, deep learning, computer vision and data science.

#### :busts_in_silhouette: Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on

I believe that technology can change the world for better or for worse,<br> 
depending on how we use it. We have advanced a lot, but we are also seeing <br>
part of this technology reproducing and worsening many social problems, such as <br>
racism, gender inequality, unequal distribution of wealth and misinformation.

To deal with these problems and make good use of technology, we need to build<br>
bridges, which happens when we collaborate with other people, especially when<br>
they have different backgrounds and life experiences.

 :sunny: So, I hope to use my work to help the world become a better place. <br>
I hope to meet and collaborate with many other people, sharing <br>
knowledge, life experiences, dreams, learnings, cultures, friendship,<br>
kindness, empathy and hope that we can grow together.:deciduous_tree:
